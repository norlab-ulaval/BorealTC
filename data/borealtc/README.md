# BorealTC: a dataset for terrain classification in boreal forests

Recorded with a Husky A200 wheeled UGV, `BorealTC` contains 116 min of Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), motor current, and wheel odometry data, focusing on typical boreal forest terrains, notably snow, ice, and silty loam. The dataset also includes experiments on asphalt and flooring. All runs were recorded in Forêt Montmorency and on the main campus of Université Laval, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada
